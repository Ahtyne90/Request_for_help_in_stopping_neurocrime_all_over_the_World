  <h2>Guidelines for Victims: How to Find the Right Specialists</h2>
  <p>
    If you suspect the presence of unauthorized micro- or nanochips operating in the 
    <strong>1–5 GHz range</strong> on or inside your body, it is essential to seek 
    professional measurements and documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following types of specialists and laboratories are most relevant for detecting and analyzing 
    such signals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Radio Engineering and Telecommunications Engineers</strong> – experts in measuring 
    radio, GSM, Wi-Fi, 5G, and radar signals using spectrum analyzers and antenna systems.</li>
    <li><strong>EMC/EMI Specialists (Electromagnetic Compatibility & Interference)</strong> – perform 
    tests in <strong>anechoic (non-reflective) chambers</strong> to analyze electromagnetic emissions 
    and susceptibility.</li>
    <li><strong>RF (Radio Frequency) Engineers</strong> – focus on frequencies from tens of kHz up to 
    hundreds of GHz, including RFID, satellite, and radar technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Electromagnetics Physicists and Engineers</strong> – model and measure fields at micro- 
    and nano-scales.</li>
    <li><strong>Radiolocation and Radar Experts</strong> – specialize in emitting and detecting radio waves.</li>
    <li><strong>Biomedical Engineers (Neurotechnology, MedTech)</strong> – measure interactions between 
    electromagnetic waves and the human body, including EEG, MEG, and electromagnetic stimulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Electromagnetic Field Metrology Laboratories</strong> – state or private facilities 
    that certify and measure radiation of devices (SAR, EIRP).</li>
    <li><strong>Near-Infrared (NIR) & Optoelectronics Specialists</strong> – for cases where near-infrared 
    fluorescence or light-based control is suspected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong style="font-weight:900; color:red;">
      Performing such measurements is absolutely necessary!
    </strong> Always request measurements in certified laboratories with 
    <strong>anechoic chambers</strong> whenever possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to anechoic chambers, measurements can also be conducted using:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Field measurements with spectrum analyzers and directional antennas.</li>
    <li>SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) analysis – often used for IoT devices and mobile phones.</li>
    <li>Interferometry and advanced electromagnetic field scanners.</li>
    <li>NIR/NIR-II fluorescence detection – if light-based or optical signaling is suspected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Potential facilities include: <strong>telecommunication research institutes</strong>, 
    <strong>universities (electronics, telecommunication, mechatronics departments)</strong>, 
    <strong>state metrology institutes</strong>, and <strong>certification laboratories</strong> 
    (CE, FCC testing centers).
