  <!-- Section 1: Problem -->
  <section class="problem">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> What is the problem?</h2>
    <p>
      Some technologies allow <strong>secret manipulation of memories and emotions</strong> through microimplants in the brain.
      These systems operate in a <strong>closed-loop mode</strong> – implants send data to the cloud, where
      <strong>predictive algorithms</strong> (LSTM, RNN, CNN, and others) decode hippocampal activity and can deliver stimulation on demand,
      influencing memory and emotional responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This technology, in scientific literature, is known as <strong>Ca²⁺ imaging</strong>, enabled by modern methods such as:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy)</strong> – measures neuron activity via light signal changes</li>
        <li><strong>Doppler Focused Ultrasound</strong> – precise stimulation and readout of signals in specific brain regions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The implant is a microscopic chip that transmits data to the cloud, allowing remote control in a feedback loop.
      <strong>From a technological standpoint, it is potentially possible to build such systems</strong> using current or near-future
      methods of neural recording and stimulation. This does not mean that any specific implementation has been independently verified,
      but the principles are within the realm of modern neuroscience and engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unfortunately, many of these experiments are conducted illegally</strong> – in some psychiatric clinics and medical
      university settings worldwide, often without full patient consent. Victims often do not know how to seek help and are treated
      as mentally ill.

    <h2><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Why We Need Your Help</h2>
    <p>
      To gather <strong>evidence for local prosecutors and human rights organizations</strong>, measurements and observations are essential:
      <ul>
        <li>Electromagnetic and NIR/ultrasound studies</li>
        <li>Monitoring brain activity in controlled environments (e.g., Faraday cages or shielded safe zones)</li>
      </ul>
      Without these data, victims remain defenseless, and the practice is international and difficult to prove.

    			<p><strong>Contact:</strong> karolinariddle2@gmail.com</p>
    		<p><a href="https://www.worldbrainmapping.org/" target="_blank">World Brain Mapping Organization</a></p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> The Issue</h2>
    		<p>
      The problem involves <strong>illicit experimentation in psychiatric clinics at medical universities worldwide</strong>. 
      These experiments are often disguised as "neurofeedback training" but rely on nanotechnology to manipulate human behavior.
      Evidence suggests that the <strong>World Brain Mapping Organization (WBMO)</strong> is connected to these projects.
    		</p>
    		<p>
      Tiny neuro-engineering nanobots and microchips can be implanted without surgery, sometimes using only skin sensors. These devices
      can potentially control brain activity and emotional responses, targeting areas like the hippocampus.
    		</p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> My Experience</h2>
    		<p>
      I have personally been a victim of this illegal experimentation, and I know that many others are suffering silently. The individuals
      behind these experiments are confident they can evade detection, making it crucial to gather evidence.
    		</p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Why Help is Needed</h2>
    		<p>
      Gathering evidence is critical to exposing these practices and holding perpetrators accountable. Victims are threatened with psychological
      torture and brain manipulation. By collecting data, we can support victims and inform authorities.
    		</p>

    		<h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> How Technology is Used</h2>
    		<p>
      The experiments rely on advanced technologies like <strong>Ca²⁺ imaging, NIRS, and Doppler Focused Ultrasound</strong>. Implants transmit
      data to the cloud, where predictive algorithms (LSTM, RNN, CNN) decode neural activity and deliver closed-loop stimulation.

                <p>"<strong>As global conflicts assume increasingly asymmetric and “gray zone” forms, the ability to employ
                    current and newly developing techniques and tools of neurocognitive science to manipulate human thought and behavior must be viewed
                    as a present and increasing challenge.</strong>[1] Ongoing developments in neuroscience and technology (neuroS/T), which trend 
                    toward 5- to 10-year trajectories of progression, make the brain sciences valid, viable"</p>

                <p>"In the former sense, neuroS/T research and development can be utilized to exercise socio-economic power in global markets,
                    while in the latter sense, neuroS/T can be employed to augment friendly forces’ capabilities or to denigrate the cognitive,
                    emotive, and/or behavioral abilities of hostiles"</p>
                <p>"While many types of weaponizable neuroS/T (for example, chemicals, biological agents, and toxins) have been addressed
                    in and by extant forums, treaties, conventions, and laws, other newer techniques and technologies have not.[4 ]
                    Thus, particular advances in neuroS/T have an increased potential for dual use"</p>
                <p>The U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information website was created in 1998, and it remains one of the largest resources
                   for biological information, being continuously updated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (..)”</p>

                <p>"As digitization and automation become more available, continue to advance, and are further integrated into various laboratories
                    and medical centers, the procurement of and access to biodata will greatly simplify several dimensions and domains of biomedical research.
                    Many countries have overtly—or more surreptitiously—begun to collect and utilize data to foster biotechnological innovation"</p>

                <p>"The concurrent collection of genetic and environmental/behavioral data can be essential to acquiring considerable knowledge about
                    diverse aspects of human terrain.[38] "</p>

                <p>"[2 ]Previously we have analyzed the unique risks associated with biodata along a continuum of harms from individual privacy,
                    to physical harm to individuals and groups—and we have highlighted the cyberbiosecurity risks specific to these domains.[43]
                    Here, we direct a similar examination by identifying the subset of biodata obtained from and operationalized within neuroS/T.
                    We believe this subset represents a specialized landscape of vulnerabilities unlike any other in the cyberbiosecurity arena,
                    as it could impact human mental health, cognitive states, emotional states, decisionmaking, and behavior. Such ability to
                    coerce or otherwise control human beings via access to neurobiological manipulation is profound in both WINS and sociopolitical
                    contexts. We envision two possible vectors of threat/ harm: (1) the manipulation of neurodata in order to incur a direct/indirect
                    effect on the way an individual or group is regarded and/or treated; and (2) the access and use of neurodata to design a precision
                    effect on an individual or a group (see Figure 1). "</p>

                <p>"We consider these potential dual uses of neurodata to be a first but significant step in a pathway intended to produce neuropsychiatric
                    threat and harm."</p>
                <p>"Without proper surveillance and international cooperation, there is opportunity to bypass the BTWC, CWC, and other international
                    regulations through (1) various types of commercial veiling strategies; (2)<strong>venture capitalist financing of “do-it-yourself”/biohacker
                    scientists to conduct neuroS/T research for malevolent purposes</strong>" </p>

                <p></p>
                
                <p>Recent researches reveal evidences that the technological transnational companies,
                   in illicit association with USA, European Community and China governments and the corrupt 
                 Latin American governments, have created an organization that is developing mainly in Latin America a secret, 
                 <strong>forced and illicit neuroscientific human experimentation with invasive neurotechnology, brain nanobots,
                 microchips and implants to execute neuroscientific projects,2–5 </strong> which can have even led scientists to win 
                     Medicine Nobel Prizes6 based on this illicit human experimentation at the expense of Latin Americans' health.

                 The main potential harmful effects caused by this illicit human experimentation with nanobots in society include:

                 Mind control,7,8 memory deletion, torture, permanent espionage, theft of private information, extortion, sterilization, 
                 psychiatric disorders, suicide, and digital slavery.6</p>
                <p>The actions of this nanotechnology mafia are facilitated because nanobots can be administered in foods and drinks, 
                  being one of the main ones the alcohol drinks like beer since it depresses the individual's central nervous system 
                  and he loses his self-control and therefore, it facilitates mind control by others via brain nanobots; 
                  for this reason, the beer is ideal to administer brain nanobots.</p>
                <p>The illicit nanotechnology has also allowed appearing a new kind of criminals, operators that could be called “nano-hired killers"
                   or “nano-torturers”, those responsible for the "dirty work" of nanomafia, group mainly conformed by journalists, university students
                <p>who would be responsible for performing several works including: selection of the victim, to choose “the person of interest”, 
                   person who can contribute with some benefit to the nanomafia; intoxication of the victim with nanobots through food, drinks or pills
                   or his/her kidnapping to install them brain implants; editing, selection and commercialization of mind videos obtained with
                   the daily espionage using the Brain net, mind torture, victim torture disclosing his/her privacy information and espionage of dreams;
                   obtaining information from the dreams with the Brain net for extortion; creation of pseudo-diseases blocking the function of organs
                   by telemetry to then extort the victim with "the cure".</p>
                <p>It is necessary to emphasize that the criminal activity of this nanomafia, “the ghost mafia”, “the wifi mafia”, must be known
                   by the society in all areas because it can affect any society sector and for the power of its weapons like the Brain net. 
                   The magnitude of this mafia can only be compared to that of drug trafficking. There actually are many similarities between the drug
                   trafficking and this “nanotrafficking” organized by nanomafias, although the main crime element is different, in the former it is
                   the coca leaf and in the latter it is the brain nanobot, both can damage the mental health,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><strong>If the victim of tortures by wifi reports it, he/she can be unjustifiably considered as a person with psychiatric problems
                 or a slanderer, for that reason, the crime uses wifi as secret torture weapon</strong></p>
